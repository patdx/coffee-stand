# Pourover Coffee Stand

!(overview.jpg)

This device holds a pourover coffee dripper. I like making coffee, and I wanted to hold my coffee dripper in a more convenient way.

The original version was square-shaped. But it was very large and ugly. I optimized the design to use as little space as possible. As a result, the final version is very curvy. It's also very cheap--only $6 dollars!

## Design

I designed the stand in SolidWorks! It looks like this:

The file [laser-pattern-ponoko.svg](laser-pattern-ponoko.svg) was submitted to the laser-cutting company.

## Materials

I used [Ponoko Acrylic](https://www.ponoko.com/make-and-sell/show-material/72-acrylic-clear).

* Acrylic - Clear
* 0.118 inches
* P1 - 7.100 inches long x 7.100 inches wide

## Cost

* Making: $3.50
* Material: $2.50
* Total: $6.00

## Results

It was a fun and interesting project, but the assembly still requires adhesive or tape to be stable. I want to improve on stability and durability in future designs.
